# PlanBuddy - Simple Goal to Plan App

A simple 2-screen Expo app that converts goals into structured, checkable task plans with a Node.js/Express backend proxy.

## Features

### Backend (Simple Proxy)
- **POST /plan** - Calls OpenAI's API to generate structured plans
- **GET /health** - Health check endpoint
- Returns tasks with title, dueDate, priority, notes, and emoji
- Works with or without OpenAI API key (uses mock data if no key)

### Frontend (2 Screens)

#### 1. Create Plan Screen
- Input: Short goal (e.g., "Get ready to launch an ecommerce store")
- Picker: Time horizon (Today / This Week)
- Button: Generate Plan ‚Üí calls backend POST /plan

#### 2. Plan Screen
- Renders returned tasks with title, dueDate, priority, notes, emoji
- Mark tasks complete with tap
- Filter by priority (All/High/Medium/Low)
- Progress tracking
- Persists to device storage

## Quick Start

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env (optional - works without it)
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start
```
